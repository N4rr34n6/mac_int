### macOS Artifact Intelligence Tool

mac_int is an interpretive DFIR intelligence and artifact correlation tool designed to automatically identify patterns and connections between parsed artifact data from the SQLite output of Yogesh Khatriâ€™s open source tool, **mac_apt**.

#### Requirements: Python3 - 32/64 bit
#### mac_apt: https://github.com/ydkhatri/mac_apt

### Background

Users of mac_int will have the ability to utilize pre-researched data interpretation for desired correlations, potentially saving time in a DFIR investigation. Numerous forensic artifacts within macOS can reflect the same event in different ways, allowing the correlation of these related data fragments to be used to provide a better, more fluid story of events that occurred on the system. Calling on the SQLite output of mac_apt, mac_int will combine previously performed research and user interaction to build a clearly defined timeline, all relevant to the needs specified by the user.
