### macOS Artifact Intelligence Tool

mac_int is an interpretive, modular DFIR intelligence and artifact correlation tool designed to automatically identify patterns and connections between parsed artifact data from the SQLite output of Yogesh Khatriâ€™s open source tool, **mac_apt**.

#### Requirements: Python 3.x - 32/64 bit
#### mac_apt: https://github.com/ydkhatri/mac_apt

### Background

Users of mac_int will have the ability to utilize pre-researched data interpretation for desired correlations, potentially saving time in a DFIR investigation. Numerous forensic artifacts within macOS can reflect the same event in different ways, allowing the correlation of these related data fragments to be used to provide a better, more fluid story of events that occurred on the system. Calling on the SQLite output of mac_apt, mac_int will combine previously performed research and user interaction to build a clearly defined timeline, all relevant to the needs specified by the user.

#### Features
- Cross-Platform (runs on any OS with Python 3.x)
- Intelligent "connective parsing" from mac_apt SQLite Database output
- Interpreted data can be displayed via HTML format for ease-of-use and readability

### Getting Started

To see all available options, run the following invocation:
```
python mac_int -h 
```

### Current Modules

mac_int operates off pre-defined Python3 scripts that are called upon using command arguments. This list is a constant work in progress - any new module based on mac_apt SQLite output can be created and added to the argument parser for command line accessibility. Below is a working table describing the current modules and their functionality:

| Module | Description | mac_apt Connections (Tables) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MountedVolumes | Names, Creation Dates, First and Last Seen Dates, and Bash Sessions | RecentItems, Spotlight-1-store, BashSessions |
| UserInfo | Parse for all related **user information** on the system, including information such as mounted volumes and installed applications | InstallHistory, NetUsage, RecentItems, Safari, Dock Items |
| InstalledApps | Total or User-Based search for **updates**, **downloaded** and **installed applications** with their corresponding **network usage** | InstallHistory, Dock Items, RecentItems, Safari, NetUsage, BashSessions, Quarantine, Spotlight-1-store |
| InternetSearch | Parse for any **internet searches** that occured | Safari, Quarantine |
| NetworkInfo | Parse for any **network activity** that occured, including info such as WiFi, DHCP, AD, and network usage | Domain_ActiveDirectory, WiFi, Network_DHCP, Network_Interfaces, Network_Details |
| SystemInfo | Parse for any **internet searches** that occured | Basic_Info |

### Example Usage

Below you will find an example of mac_int usage, utilizing the `-mv` switch to run the Mounted Volumes module with username *"justin.boncaldo"* and output to a specified directory:
```
mac_int.py C:\Users\burnh\Desktop\Capstone\Mac_apt_Output\mac_apt02.db justin.boncaldo -o C:\Users\burnh\Desktop\Capstone\Mac_apt_Output -mv
```

Below is another example, this time utilizing the `-a` switch to run all mac_int modules together:
```
mac_int.py C:\Users\burnh\Desktop\Capstone\Mac_apt_Output\mac_apt02.db justin.boncaldo -a 
```
