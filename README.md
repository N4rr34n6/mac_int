### macOS Artifact Intelligence Tool

mac_int is an interpretive DFIR intelligence and artifact correlation tool designed to automatically identify patterns and connections between parsed artifact data from the SQLite output of Yogesh Khatriâ€™s open source tool, **mac_apt**.

#### Requirements: Python3 - 32/64 bit
#### mac_apt: https://github.com/ydkhatri/mac_apt

### Background

Users of mac_int will have the ability to utilize pre-researched data interpretation for desired correlations, potentially saving time in a DFIR investigation. Numerous forensic artifacts within macOS can reflect the same event in different ways, allowing the correlation of these related data fragments to be used to provide a better, more fluid story of events that occurred on the system. Calling on the SQLite output of mac_apt, mac_int will combine previously performed research and user interaction to build a clearly defined timeline, all relevant to the needs specified by the user.

#### Features
- Cross-Platform (runs on any OS with Python3)
- Intelligent parsing from mac_apt SQLite Database output
- Interpreted data is displayed via HTML format for ease-of-use and readability

### Modules

mac_int operates off predefined Python3 scripts that are called upon using command arguments. This list is a work in progress - any newly created module can be created and added to the argument parser for mac_int for command line accessibility. Below is a working table describing the current modules and their functionality:

| Module | Description | mac_apt Connections (Tables) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MountedVolumes | Names, Creation Dates, First and Last Seen Dates, and Bash Sessions | Spotlight-1-store, BashSessions |
| InstalledApps | Updates, Downloaded and Installed Applications | InstallHistory, DockItems, NetUsage |
| UserInfo | Parse for all related **user information** on the system, including information such as mounted volumes and installed applications | InstallHistory, NetUsage, RecentItems, Safari, DockItems |
| NetworkActivity | Parse for any **network activity** that occured, including info such as WiFi, DHCP, AD, and network usage | Network_DHCP, NetUsage |
